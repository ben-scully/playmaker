# Project Plan Template

feel free to vary

## Learning Objectives
What do you want to get better at?

1. Taking an idea (user stories already conceived) & working out how to build it (what technologies, tools to use etc).

2. Building a Prototype / MVP of an idea as quickly as possible.

3. Learn about/how to automate/outsource as much as possible (scaffolding, libraries).

4. CSS. Not to make the most beautiful web app in the world but so it looks professional enough. I'd hire clever designers to really make it look good.

## Description
A description of your project:

A 'playbook'^^ creator for the sport of Touch that is used to share various moves within a Touch team.

^^ 'playbook' = a book containing diagrams and descriptions of maneuvers & strategies.

Each 'page' in a 'playbook' is a different maneuver. My web app would allow users to either create a page for a playbook or view an existing page in a playbook.

Creating a 'page' would consist of multiple 'diagrams' which make up a 'sequence'.

One 'diagram':
1. Selecting an area of the Touch field.
2. Placing defenders & attackers on the Touch field.
3. Placing instructions for each defender or attacker in the form of arrows or arrow like symbols.

Surrounding features which may exist in the future are:
* Login authentication.
* A method of sharing (email, .pdf etc)
* x2 types of user. One creating playbook(s)/pages(s). One viewing existing playbook(s).

## Technologies
What technologies are you going to play with?

I haven't thought this through very far, so the only technologies I'm thinking about/using at the moment is HTML5 Canvas. With HTML5 Canvas I'm using drag/drop, click/drop with mouse listeners.

## Milestones
What milestones and timeline do you want to commit to?

1. Crude X's (defenders), O's (attackers), A's (arrows) being put on the Cavnas/'field'.

2. A's (arrows) being adjustable; length extension, start/finish points moveable.

3. A's (arrows) being curve'able'; drag a mid point in an arrow and it begin to bow (BÃ©zier curve?).

4. A's (arrows) having different styles. Dotted, arrow pointed, T-junction pointed.
